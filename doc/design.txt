Architecture:
The main modules are:
1. The UI - web based on angularjs 2
2. API server written in tornado
3. DB based on SQLAlchemy

At each request from the UI to the API server,, the API server will query the db to get the current state
The API server will have an internal representation of the state of the system
The API server will update the DB according to the action that was made
the API server will response to the UI request

For testing a predefined game state can be used

???
There is a duplication of code between the database.model and game
Is there a way to get rid of the duplication and still be able to separate the DB and the API server?
